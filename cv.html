    <p>Hey, my name is Gabriel, and I'm a computer systems management and programming student in the 12th grade. I am currently developing an app using Flutter, Node.js, Git, and GitHub for my final professional aptitude project. Since I was a child, I've always liked technology. My first contact with programming was when I was 15 years old, writing my first 'hello world,' and today, at 18, I'm looking for opportunities to develop my soft and hard skills.</p>
